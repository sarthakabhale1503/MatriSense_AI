# MatriSense AI 🩺🤰

**MatriSense AI** is an AI-powered maternal healthcare application designed to support **ASHA workers** and **expecting mothers** by enabling early risk detection, digital health tracking, and continuous pregnancy guidance, especially in rural and underserved areas.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Maternal health monitoring in rural areas is often manual, fragmented, and delayed. ASHA workers rely on paper records, making it difficult to track ANC visits, identify high-risk pregnancies early, and provide timely guidance. Expecting mothers lack continuous access to reliable pregnancy information and reminders, increasing health risks.
